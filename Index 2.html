    <h3>In the Spider's Lair</h3>
    <p>The air grows thick and suffocating as you move deeper into the lair. The ground feels sticky beneath your feet, and every step seems to make the silence around you feel heavier.<br><br>
    
    Everywhere you look, thick webs hang like traps, and the walls are crawling with movement, though you can't quite see
    what's there. The faint sound of skittering legs echoes through the darkness.<br><br>
    
    You know they're watching. Aragog's brood is close, and the only way out is deeper into the lair, through the tangled
    webs and whatever creatures hide in the shadows. The deeper you go, the more you feel the forest tightening its grip on
    you.<br>
    You stumble into a cave...
