    <h2>The Cursed Web</h2>
    <p>The Forbidden Forest has always been a place of legends, but now it feels more like a nightmare you can't wake up from.<br>
    The trees tower above, twisting and turning as if they’ve grown to trap anyone who dares enter. And at the heart of this
    dark maze lies Aragog's lair.<br><br>
    No one ever leaves once they're caught in his web, but somehow, you find yourself here, with only one option: make it to
    the Chamber of Secrets. If you can get through that, Hogwarts might be in your reach.<br><br>
    But it's not going to be easy. The forest doesn't let anyone pass without testing their resolve. And the closer you get
    to the Chamber, the more you'll realize that the forest itself is alive—waiting to see who's strong enough to survive.</p>
